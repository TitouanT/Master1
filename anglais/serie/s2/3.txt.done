Young Sheldon - Season 2 - Episode 12
Sheldon is at the hospital for a few days because they had to remove his gallbladder.
He does not want to stay there and want to go home.
As a result he complains a lot about his bed, the food and he even made a clown lady cry because her balloon dogs are not realistic enough.
But in the last day, he got a roommate. At first, he complained about it too.
They then got to speak a little and Sheldon put things into perspective because his roommate is there for heart surgery.
He left the hospital while the other boy was in surgery and as a goodbye gave an Iron Man comics to the nurse to pass to his roommate.
