The good doctor - Season 2, Episode 17
Shaun have been forced to work as a Patologist despite his wish to be a surgeon.
At the begining of this episode, it is clear that hasn't made peace with this new situation.
The patient is a young men with a exceptionally large tumor, weighing over two hundred pound. There is more blood in it than in the rest of his body, so it is draining his energy away. He was classified as not operable but an experimental treatment might change that.
Eventually, they found out that the tumor had grown at much more higher rate than they predected. Thus making the removal impossible with out "bleeding him to death".
One of the doctors finally found a workable angle and they proceeded with the operation. But a complication came up in the OR (Operation Room) and one of the surgeon wanted to abort the operation. Then someone called Shaun to the rescue and he found a way to play along with that complication and made it possible for it to continue as planed.
His success for the day made him confident enough to confront the head of his department. He ordered him to reinstate him and, even after being explained that if security was to be called then he would be fired, he continued. The episode ends with Shaun walking out of the Hospital at night, in the rain.
