Bilangual Evalutation Under Study

This work has been splited into tasks:
	1. extract data from xml files          -> ./parsexml.py
	2. translation of the english version   -> ./translate.py and ./translateOne.py
	3. implementation of the Bleu algorithm -> ./bleu.py
	4. evaluation of some talks translation -> ./evaluation.py

to test the results, you only have to execute `python evaluation.py`
